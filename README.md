# Computer Vision RPS

# Milestone 1

Teachable Machine was used to train a model with four classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors, and Nothing (for when the player is not doing a pose). Around 300 images were added to each class. The images were taken from as many different directions and with as many different variations of the hand positions as possible. It seems to be very good at detecting the Nothing position, pretty good at detecting Scissors and Paper, and not very good at detecting Rock. 

The model was downloaded via Tensorfile in two files, keras_model.h5 and labels.txt. The files were added to the computer vision repo on github.
